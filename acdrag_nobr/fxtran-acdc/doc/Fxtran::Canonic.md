# NAME

[Fxtran::Canonic](../lib/Fxtran/Canonic.pm)

# DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this module is to provide a canonic layout for XML documents generated
by fxtran.

The main function provided by this module is `makeCanonic`, which expects an XML
document generated by fxtran, using the `-canonic` option.

Bringing a FORTRAN/XML document into the canonic layout involves the following steps:

- Turning simple `IF` statements into `IF` blocks.
- Resolving `ASSOCIATE` constructs.
- Removing `DIMENSION` attributes and having each entity declaration
having its own array dimensions.
- Resolving ambiguous references (array references vs function calls).
- Removing some architecture specific `#ifdef` blocks.
- Removing compiler specific directives.
- Splitting each program unit into: a use part with use statements, 
a declaration part with all declaration statements and an
execution part with all executions statements.
- Applying cycle specific simplifications.

Another important function provided by this module is `indent` which
indents a FORTRAN/XML document.
