`fxtran-makemaker` is a simple `Makefile` generator for external test
cases build with `fxtran-f90`. 

When invoked, `fxtran-makemaker` will:

- Generate include files for subroutines.
- Scan source code and detect dependencies.
- Write a `Makefile` to compile the code.

The user is expected to provide a file named `Makefile.inc` which contains
the compiler name and options.

# SYNOPSIS

    $ cd compile.gpu_nvhpc_d
    $ fxtran-makemaker --SRC ../src

# DESCRIPTION

`fxtran-makemaker` is a simple `Makefile` generator for external test
cases build with `fxtran-f90`. 

When invoked, `fxtran-makemaker` will:

- Generate include files for subroutines.
- Scan source code and detect dependencies.
- Write a `Makefile` to compile the code.

The user is expected to provide a file named `Makefile.inc` which contains
the compiler name and options.

# OPTIONS

- --SRC

    Path to directory containing source code and `fxtran.conf` file.

- --assume-generated-util-modules

    If this option is passed, then do not look for util\_\*\_mod.F90 dependencies
    and assume these will be generated by the build process.
